POP 3.9.4 changelog (NEW GAME IS REQUIRED):


Prophesy of Pendor v3.9.4 was tested with Mount and Blade Warband version 1.173.


KNOWN ISSUES
1. The "hold F1 flag" can't be used together with advanced formations (jkl keys; like shielsdwall), otherwise selected soldiers MAY start to move backward to the edge of the map. With "advanced formations" use mini-map, "hold this position" and "advance/fall back ten paces" to move groups around. POP's default (build-in Warband's) formations work fine.
2. If during fight enemy stuck in inaccessible area (e.g. inside building structure) use CTRL+F4 (kill one enemy). It is not recognized as a cheat, there is no punishment, but overusing it will kill the fun pretty quickly.
3. If the game become too slow, restart it. Due to Warband memory leak a play session will slow down over time (many reloads accelerate this process).
4. Lords attack player during prisoners escape - restart current game session (Warband bug).
5. "Cows in the water" - remove TexturesHD folder found in the main Warband folder. 
6. NPC party stuck on river bank or shore - try right mouse click on it.
7. Very rarely the new garrisons/prisoners hotkeys MAY produce unexplained errors due to improper usage by players (e.g. used "take all prisoners" hotkeys on the garrisoned soldiers). This feature is build on the top of inaccessible part of engine, so use it with care, accordingly to the provided instruction:
- select troops/prisoner stack AND hold one of the keys combination listed below AND press give/hire/take/capture button
-- capture all prisoners - LEFT CTRL + A 
-- take all prisoners from garrison - LEFT CTRL + A
-- give all prisoners to garrison - LEFT CTRL + D
-- hire all soldiers - LEFT CTRL + S
-- give all soldiers to garrison - RIGHT CTRL + ARROW LEFT
-- take all soldiers from garrison - RIGHT CTRL + ARROW RIGHT
-- move stack one position up inside garrison -  ARROW UP - (doesn't work if single soldier in the stack)
-- move stack one position down inside garrison - ARROW DOWN - (doesn't work if single soldier in the stack)
-- move stack to the top of garrison - PAGE UP - (doesn't work if single soldier in the stack)
-- move stack to the bottom of garrison - PAGE DOWN - (doesn't work if single soldier in the stack)


NOTES
1. If you think that archery deals too much / not enough damage then open "module.ini" file located in the mod folder and find "missile_damage_speed_power = 1.2" . Reduce number (minimum 0.1) to make archery more deadly,  increase (maximum 2.0) to obtain opposite result.
2. How to reduce chance for save corruption (apply to any Warband mod):
- when you want to start the new game, restart Warband first
- don't play with realistic saves
- use all 9 save slots (note: if all 9 slots are occupied, the new game can't be started - delete one)
- save in scenes e.g. tavern
- if you want to save on the world map then stop to pause the game, count to 5 (so scripts running in the background have time to finish), press save


BUGS/ISSUES
- added missing penalty for siege retreat when player uses edge of the scene ("Leave area")
- Village Elder quest "rescue daughter": 
-- added check to make sure that targeted lord is not imprisoned at the moment when quest is given (as it may take him longer to escape and respawn than duration of the quest)
-- on the rare occasions there was no dialog option to ask quest target lord for a prisoner  
- quest "rescue prisoner" - initial +1 relation boost for accepting quest transferred to the reward as may be exploitable: accept quest -> relations +1 -> "can't do it" -> no relation loss -> immediately accept quest again -> ...
- conversation with companion "I'd like to ask you something." - added "go back" dialog option
- added missing hair styles (not new) for woman and custom_woman skins - no more bald Fierdswain and Falcons females; player may easier add new hairstyles (no coding required, just replace placeholders with desired meshes)      
- added missing lods for native beard_j	
- terrain near Almerra Castle is passable
- fixed glitch: ask Arandur/Quigfen for troops -> see their offer -> press on NPC's portrait -> select any lord -> go back -> different offer, thousands soldiers   	
- exploit: player is a king -> ask marshal to take fief -> marshal conquers fief and leaves part of siege army (e.g. KO knights) as garrison -> player has unrestricted access to the garrison of the unassigned fief (and takes mentioned free KO knights)
-- player can't take (only give) troops to an unassigned fief
-- if player assigns an unassigned fief to him/herself/husband all garrisoned units >31 will be disbanded   	
- with horse archers AI enabled: if horse is killed, raider may stuck in attack animation; thanks to Vetrogor   
- slider on the ally/enemy part of the troop ratio bar should be displayed properly (reverted changes) 


GAMEPLAY
- rune weapons:
-- Large Pouch of Diamonds for mine location (was Qualis Gem)
-- one Qualis Gem and one Gold Bar for "strange" item
-- one Qualis Gem and Large Pouch of Diamonds for enhanced item (were 2 Qualis Gems)
- garrison left by NPCs (only if they don't belong to the faction of which player is the king) in a just taken fief is configurable in CAMP -> POP OPTIONS; NOTE: the world balance was NOT tested with values different than DEFAULT
- Eyegrim the Devourer - every 25 hours:
-- if he is not with his army ("dead"), he will be summoned back
-- he will convert 100% alive party members and 25% prisoners from each stack in to his undead roster (remaining alive prisoners will be kept for the next time); unit level:
--- > 30 become Fallen Warrior						
--- > 26-30 - Fallen Veteran
--- > 15-25 - Fallen Footman						
--- < 15 - Fallen
- all bandits lairs - larger variety of enemy units will spawn (2 -> 5 types; e.g. chance that 15 Snake Cult Armsmen spawn at the same moment was greatly reduced); soldiers that have a chance to spawn (high tier ones have much less chance; leaders not listed):
-- sea_raider_lair: Vanskerry Marauder, Vanskerry Raider, Vanskerry Warrior, Vanskerry Jarl

- added new quests:
-- "The Old Tale (part 1)" - no time limit, no level limit, can be started by talking to a peculiar scholar
-- optional "The Old Tale (part 2)" - no time limit, no level limit (will yield immense and useful rewards by the conclusion of everything)

- Haringoth Castle siege AI
- Silveredge Keep wooden ramp between roof and tower

-- the bounty quest - "bounty points" given after each battle are proportional to the player contribution (party strength); bringing low number or/and quality units to aid strong friends in a fight will yield very few "bounty points" (minimum 1)
- rewards of the guildmaster's track down bandits quest are proportional to the player contribution (party strength) in the final battle (when targeted enemy is defeated; minimum 100 gold and 100 xp)

POP 3.9.1 changelog:

"FIXED BUGS/ISSUES"
1. QUESTS
- "Capture enemy hero" - quest rewards were properly given to the player (shown in on-screen log), but amount of gold was always displayed as "0"
- "Band of Looters" from guildmaster quest are set as neutral to all (so only player can kill them)
- "Raise troops" - Warband bug - money reward was always 1 denar due to wrong syntax "(val_mul, ":quest_gold_reward", ":quest_gold_reward", 7),"
- "Train peasants against bandits" - gained renown was taken from the last battle; now it is calculated properly (3-22 for level 1-62)
- "Village infested by bandits" - gained renown was random 1-10; as now quest is harder renown is increased as well (5-27 for level 1-62)
- troops in Jatu Mercenary Heartbeat quest
2. MENUS/OPTIONS
- if player kill horse on the battlefield, option "Display a message on player kill" doesn't report that rider was killed
- upkeep in the "weekly budget report" and in party menu should be the same
- if player initiated the battle AI will be able to rescue/capture prisoners
3. TEXT:
- fixed and updated latest Chinese translation
- corrected more spelling mistakes
4. DIALOGS/MESSAGES
- become king -> crown received -> pledge to another king -> become lord -> rebel and start own faction again -> no coronation as crown given already -> player stuck as "Rogue Leader"
- tavern talk with Travelers when player selected some special combination of answers during character creation
- Clarissa of Pent "Maybe next time." option   
- player will pay the same sum for "I wish to make peace with the ..." when speaking with kings and lords
- female character can't change outfit/hat of her husband
- dialog when the arbalest is given to the player
- lord paying "0 denars" during "exchange fiefs" operation
- "your armor is ready" message from Alexios (now "... item ...")
- question in the Boadice's intro
5. SCENES
- removed few "invalid items" from on-street merchants shops in towns
- Talon Castle sneak in (guards spawn inside walls)
- prison door in Dagon Castle and Castle Alden
- error opcode messages during Snake Stronghold siege; (never seen this error in my games and wasn't able to recreate it, but it may be fixed)
- Tuldar Foltress siege scene
- Ironworks (floating helmet)
- Nal Tar left ladder should be used more during siege
- Fletcher battle scene - attacking soldiers may stack on a rock placed next to the spawn point
- adjusted slightly ladders-walls regions in all three Empire towns
- added inventory box to Singal siege scene
6. Some lords with poor income (no fiefs) were unable to hire enough soldiers to leave walled fief
7. Script "Horse Archers AI":
- should work a tiny bit faster
- horse archers ordered to use blunt weapon should work better
- changed "pos.." as some was used by AI scripts to store values
8. Script "Lancer AI"
- added code to cover all soldiers on foot so they won't use lances (Tournament, Blunt Tip, Double Sided, Light, Heavy, Great, various Long Knights, various Long Cavalry, Jatu Honor, Melitine, Melitine Impaler, Banner of Sarleon) band Black Iron Spear
- it cover field battles, fief sieges/missions, villages fights/raids, lairs fights
- changed "pos.." as some was used by AI scripts to store values
9. Issue with looting of gold bar, noldor goods, various loot - if fallen soldier had special goods and lots of other items in the inventory then: they were impossible to loot or, due to low "score" of these special goods, they were replaced by arguably better items. Changes:
- special goods have higher "score",
- after fight calculate "the max number of special goods possibly remaining on the battlefield" (e.g. player beaten 10 Ravenstern Rogue Knights -> max 10x3 Gold Bars + max 10x1 chests of Various Loot); if:
-- given special goods appear in the final loot, then proceed as normal
-- given special goods don't appear in the final loot, but enemy soldiers carried them, then: take party looting skill and calculate ONE BY ONE, SEPARATELY (from previous example 30 times for Gold Bars, 10 for Various Loot) the chance of the each special goods to be added to the final loot (skill 0-14 -> chance 1%-15%, max 2 pieces each)
10. Exploit:
- player wants to join siege defenders -> presses e.g. "inventory key" on "Join the battle." menu -> enemies is forced to retreat
- player as mercenary fight against own employer -> relations drops <0 -> player can siege employer's fiefs -> siege successful, no garrison, +X renown -> can't own fiefs as mercenary -> siege empty fief -> siege successful, +X renown -> can't own fiefs as mercenary -> ...
- player become lord of faction_1 -> player relations align with faction_1 -> player can decrease relations with faction_2 independently from "faction_1 vs. faction_2" relations -> no war between faction_1 and faction_2, but player can happily siege faction_2 fiefs, against the will of his/her own king -> as no war between faction_1 and faction_2, faction_2 doesn't try to take lost fiefs back -> player can take fiefs of a faction_2 one by one as no counteroffensive is present (as no official war was declared); it might be possible to start war between two friendly kingdoms which AI doesn't "want" (without reason, quest etc.); now it is similar to options which player acting as a king has - no official war declared, no right to siege

- kings won't exchange their original capitals with player
- if NPC wants to leave walled fief, she/he must have army at least 60 strong (was 70)
- added more info about lords to the Characters reparts (how many fit soldiers given lord has, what is his ideal army size)
4. HEROES
- leaders of mercenary parties hired by kings (including player) will appear with full health
- mortal Heater Shield won't be unlockable (for CKO) by Burilgi as Syla already doing that
5. One extra crown will be received during coronation:
- male player can ask his wife to put it on via "Could you reconsider your outfit?" dialog (keep item in your "Household Possessions")
- female player can give it to her husband during standard chit-chat (keep item with you)
6. Female player will pay 50% of garrisons upkeep (which is 25% wage "when in party") in fiefs which belongs to her husband; as a result these fiefs will pay 25% less for garrisons and accumulated wealth will end up in husband's pocket (will have more money to recruit soldiers to the field army or pay upkeep) 
7. Qualis Heroes and enemies to the player (relation<0) commanding own armies during the battles
8. The "size of the garrison hired after enemy AI successfully sieged fief" is controlled by "Campaign AI Difficulty" - less capable players can adjust campaign difficulty to better match their skills; number of chances to recruit reinforcements (possibly more units; +50% for towns) --- number of upgrade runs (better quality units; +100% for towns):
-- "Easy": 4---2
-- "Medium": 8---3
-- "Hard": 12---5 (no changes, default 3.9 values).
-- player's faction when she/he act as mercenary or lord will have always 12---5 (no changes, default 3.9 values).
-- player's faction when she/he act as king will have always 2---0 (no changes, default 3.9 values).
9. Added more troops trees to the Reports section.
10. Increased the daily spawning chance of free knights and sergeants in player's fiefs. As a result player should get 250% more knights (but don't be too excited because of this number) and 13% more sergeants.
11. The minor knighthood orders (*** existing ones will stay as the are, but the new ones should follow below rules):
- reviewed equipment which should better match knighthood name,

- all available items will appear on the CKO upgrade lists
- black screen after CKO upgrade (press the "leave" key)
- added warning when player tries to join CKO
2. KNIGHTHOOD ORDERS
- "bounty quests"
-- only KO's enemies accounted towards it
-- added missing "insults"
- quest to "win a tournament" will fail ONLY if both conditions are true: "no more days left" AND "tournament in the quest city is on"; otherwise it will be canceled, in which case cool down time is reduced 7days->1day
- minor custom KOs soldiers should wear less "extravagant" outfits
- exploit: for orders, especially "free" ones (e.g. Griffons from "the letter" option) it was possible to progress in their hierarchy by simply creating (add x rank points) and dismantling (subtract 0 rank points) chapters
3. NOLDOR 
- "defense bonus" (x2), when player auto resolve battle against them
- trade Qualis for Noldor troops when party is full (the gem disappears and Noldors were lost)
- modifier "tempered" not assigned to sword received as a reward in the Noldor tournament
- training grounds - max number of opponents is 4 (for high player level)
4. UNIQUE HEROES/CAPTAINS
- will not be enlisted by kings as mercenaries if: given hero executed by player or asked for items before or already on the map or imprisoned by player
- accept items from captured unique spawn heroes when inventory is full
- Maltise cannot be moved to the castle prison
- Dread Legion will not spawn, if Maltise executed by player or asked for unique items
- script error, when player (as a king) dismissed own mercenary company
- hired mercenary captains should follow player more willingly (order "Follow me")
- faction of captain must follow faction of his party - fixed for Jarryn_Maersow (Commoners->Adventurer Companies), Burilgi the Usurper (D'Shar_Raiders->Singalians), Sheik Shalavan (Singalians->Rogue Knights), Syla Uzas (Adventurer Companies->Rogue Knights)
5. COMPANIONS
- player couldn't persuade lord-companions, who left his/her faction, to rejoin (fixed thanks to Leonion)
- companion set to "stay away from fight", then promoted to minister, able to clone himself (is in the castle and party)
- "king support opponent speeches" for Donavan, Sara and Sir Alistair
- companions returning from missions (e.g. gather support) will be able to rejoin player army even if party reached max size
- exploit: it was possible to access Lethaldiran equipment by players with level <30, by talking to him after won battle (on the "Let your heroes select gear from the item pool." screen)
- when Julia joins the nobles, she gets title "Tribune" instead of e.g. "Lady" - now in line with here "nobility acceptance speech"
6. WORLD MAP
- lord by himself or with very small warband was able to sally out walled fief to engage low threat enemy bands; then such a lord was patrolling surrounding area
- player leads allies to break the siege, but after winning all allied lords and their armies end up in player party (listed only on the world map)
- ladies-in-waiting will spawn as prisoners only if their kingdom is active (alive); rescued ladies of fallen kingdoms will have only option to enlist them
- it was possible to capture undead, if player defeated "routing warriors" of Snake or Heretics warbands
- spawn chance for "Ebony Gauntlet Prisoner Train"
- "Modify Banner" - player will swap his banner with the lord's one (lords won't end up with the same default banner (sun and red cross on yellow field); side effect - by swapping banners it is possible to unify player kingdom color/heraldry (e.g. black flags for newly re-established Pendor kingdom)    
7. BATTLEFIELD
- claimants don't change their starting outfits between civilian (for interiors) and battle ready (for exteriors)
- Tab behavior in combat: player fell -> taken as prisoner -> escaped -> TAB in the next fight = fight automatically lost
- Retreat (F1->F5) battlefield option
- after issuing order: "use only blunt weapon", units without such items will use the first melee weapon from their inventory instead of fists; see note about cavalry in the "Known Issues/Notes" section
- after won battle the "loot screen" appears before the "prisoners screen" (exploit: make an army full of expendable troops, win battle (including auto resolve), release all your troops, all loot for player only, profitsss)
- opcode error during siege, when player ask the nearest soldier from player party to share ammo (by pressing "o") 
8. AL-AZIZ
- drunkman "wine problem"
- gem weapon not received when player inventory is full
9. QUESTS/MISSIONS
- player does not take "track down bandits" quest, in the meantime quest's bandits are killed -> player speak with guildsman -> script error
- tutorial merchant quest - corrected number of required soldiers
- tutorial merchant quest - during the "hideout part" common lair leaders will spawn instead of heroes (reduced hp was shared amongst all of them)
- during "free lord form prison" quest player has the same items inside and outside
- player replaced minister -> latest quests given by minister were aborted (penalties), even if were successfully completed
- after successful "pretender quest" relation with pretender faction was set to 0 and as a result no lords helped player in the battles (even if player acts as a marshal); now it is set to 60
- "deal with looters" - spawned quest looters were killed by AI parties; now they are neutral to all other groups on the map and only player can hunt them down
- exploit: in all bandits’ hideouts, part of the loot came from the last player battle (as a result e.g. high quality Noldor items in a D'Shar bandits lair)
- during "sneak-in" or "rescue prisoner" missions kingdom "tier 3" soldiers were spawned instead of "tier 2"; rebalanced kingdoms' "tier 1 - tier 5" units (e.g. D'Shar was way too strong) 
- Guildmaster's quest "Retaliate for border incident" had only "fail" condition, was unable to be completed 
- when group of lords is in the same room (e.g. during fest) more than one can share rumors with player 
- The Ghost Lady:
-- disappearing Mistress during the quest
-- Mistress doesn't "follow" player in castles/towns during the quest
-- no more "Surrender or die. Make your choice." dialog
10. CORRECTED LEONION'S TWEAKS
- 20.2 and 32 - Marius Imperator should not act as a lord of defeated faction, Lord Leonius should
- 38 relation gain with friendly lords after large battles or sieges automatic:
-- companions, who don't act as lords, won't receive relations boost with player after battles or sieges
-- if first lord in the combined armies has relations with player <-5, relation was boosted to 100
-- relations with lords who doesn't like player were boosted as well
- 28 fief exchange:
-- player can't handle own court (could end up as a fief-less king/queen)
-- as king/queen: exchanging fief is not treated in the same way as distributing a new fief (where relation increases/decreases with all lords)
-- as king/queen: for those vassals that only have villages, the option to exchange fiefs was only there if player had a spare village him/herself (no matter how many spare castles or towns player had - option wasn't there)
-- as a vassal: for those lords that only had villages, the option to exchange fiefs was only there if player had a spare village yourself
-- exploit of exchanging plain fief for one with KO; player will be compensated extra up to 10k for offering fief with any KO; lord will get more money for fief with chapter (120k for Qualis KO, 60k for one of 5 factional ones, 40k for the rest)
-- exploit: if player carefully chose his lords (only good-natured, upstanding and martial ones, and they are not enemies of each other), by exchanging two similar fiefs back and forth, he/she get +10 relation with one lord each time, for a bit of money
- feasts relations modifications (fixed thanks to Leonion)
- some NPC (Iris, Trainer etc.) treated as sergeants by minor KOs crated by lords (fixed thanks to Leonion)
11. Reduced a bit chance to corrupt save games during save operation on the world map by decreasing frequency of less essential background calculations:
- achievements checked 1hr->24hr
- Leonion's tweak 32 (forcing lords to leave dead factions) checked 1hr-> 2days
- Leonion's tweak 29 - reduced on screen spam messages and removed one trigger checked every 12hr by moving this feature to the Tavernkeepers
12. CORONATION GIFTS
- no spaces in inventory and coronation gifts were lost
- exploit: player can only receive one crown helmet
13. SOUND
- arena sound would cut abruptly shortly after the beginning of a tournament round (added delay)
- the arena/tavern infinite sound loop
14. SCENES
- fixed passage between Avendor's Arena -> City Center and City Center -> Arena 
- fixed passage between Sher Quila's Prison -> City Center and City Center -> Prison
- Sher Quila was marked as a "tower siege"
- Seven Cross Keep spawn point (lord rescue mission)
- removed walls from Gunders Lodge interior as some NPCs could spawn behind them
- Snake Stronghold:
-- removed chest from the initial scene (wooden interior)
-- improved AI pathfinding
- fixed some rare NPC barefoot
- fixed the body of arena fighters
- cloned wife/spouse
- open the cells doors in prison scene as players were unable to reach NPCs in: Marleons, Ansen Lodge, Shadi Shahid, Talon Castle, Valorshield Castle and High Pass Fortress
- left hand side balcony is accessible in (lords sometimes spawn there): Torbah and Nal Tar
- shadow under the main table in Stoutheart Castle
15. MENUS
- Troops Trees in Reports: removed duplicate troops and cover situation when troops have more than 24 items (error messages before)
- fixed transparent items in the "achievement" or "order established" screens
- corrected "few" spelling mistakes
- when negotiating a peace with enemy king and declining the proposal, the two factions make peace anyway,
- when negotiating a peace with enemy king and accepting the proposal, the two factions make peace, but the next screen shows pre-battle options
- short initial description for village prosperity level 9 (during visiting location)
- removed minimaps from two textures used in menus (Rane and loot images should load a bit faster)
- added warning to the dialog line, by selecting which player with renown >1000, disables fights with Belligerent Drunk 
16. CUSTOM FONT
- fixed font kerning for potential localizations 
- corrected height of all characters with accents
- is optional (players can enable it themselves) as too many confused Mac, Linux and non-English players
17. TROOPS
- fixed low autocalc attack value of: Possessed Doomguide, Fallen Melitine Noble, Heretic Invoker
- assigned correct skin for D'Shar rogues (Young Adv., Squires, Knights)
18. "Advanced Formations bug":
- description: sometimes group (like infantry) in AF (ranks, shield wall, wedge) will move back to the edge of the map or may not response to the player's orders; it is often happening when player use mini map or "hold F1 flag" to position groups, which are in AF; F1-F1 order works fine, but selected group will move or form new shape on player position (not very convenient)
- applied solution: player's army will use Warbands formations as default; it is up to player, if he/she want to use AF or not (by pressing j, k or l and using F1-F1); lords will use AF as they used to do (if "Enable Formations" are ticked in "POP OPTIONS")
- new battle plan - hopefully no (or at least much less) f1f1f1f2f2f3f4... clicks on the beginning of each field battle:
-- infantry (group1) - move 25m forward, stand_closer, stand_closer (3 rows),
-- archers (group2) - move 10m forward, stand_closer,
-- cavalry (group3) - move 40m left, a bit behind, stand_closer, stand_closer, mount_horses
-- the rest (group4-9) - move 40m right, stand_closer.
- foot soldiers move forward to make room for cavalry - faster positioning (and only 2-3 dismounted soldiers out of 60)
- group4-9 is on the left as horse archers are in this group and they fire to the left
19. very expensive items in Quigfen's and Calanon's shops shouldn't disappear; both shops should restock a bit more quickly
20. OTHER
- fief's mineral bonus implemented as was originally planned; as a result chance to get 300 increased from 5% to 11%
- UllrVetr Manifest exploit
- corrected strength headers (from str_34 to str_120) so decimal value match hexadecimal


"GAMEPLAY"
1. Reloading game doesn't change outcomes of some events, e.g. asking travelers for treasure chests like the Red Brotherhood one, chance of capture the Qualis Gem heroes, rewards in Noldor tournament. If after few reloads result is the same, accept it and move one (as in some cases even "failure" may influence player's next move). Spend more time in the actual game, not in the load menu. Remember: defeat/failure doesn't always mean "the end" - it may be just the beginning of a tale, which you share with your grandchildren when the time comes :)
2. CHARACTER CREATION
- options to start without banner ("your father was ..."): merchant ship captain, retired adventurer, wandering nomad clan leader, rough and mysterious figure
- increased starting relations penalties with the major kingdoms -5 -> -10 (depends on chooses)
- if "your father was a wandering nomad clan leader" then Inquisition -10 
- redistributed few skills points assigned during character creation - max skill level capped at 7:
-- stage1 - misterious1 - looting 4->3, tracking 0->1
-- stage2 - succmarch2 - trade 2->1, athletics 0->1
-- stage2 - fend2 - looting 3->2, ironflesh 0->1
-- stage3 - engineer3 - engineer 4->3, athletics 0->1
-- stage4c - selfmarch4c - trade 2->1, prisoner management 0->1
-- stage4d - selfmarch4d - trade 1->0, tactics 0->1
3. Kingdoms strengths have been rebalanced and tested - games should be more random as major factions are more equal 
4. FIEFS
- compensation for not being awarded a conquered fief 900->2500 denars
- income +25% upgrade time -33%, upgrade cost -20%
- siege ladders build time +3-4 hr as more than one is in use
- increase penalty for stealing cows: honor -1 -> -5, lord relation -3 -> -5, village relation -5 -> -15
- increase penalty for stealing food: honor -1 -> -5, lord relation -1 -> -5, village relation (capped at -55): -1 -> -5 for player village, -3 -> -15 otherwise
5. Prisoners prices -15%, lords’ ransom -15%
6. Mounted archers =>30 will cost +20%
7. CUSTOM KNIGHTHOOD ORDER
- thanks to Dusk Voyager's script CKO units will equip all items from inventory (e.g. all will spawn with two quivers)
- training progress is checked more often (-25%) - should reduce training time
- knights and sergeants genders can be set independently
- rearranged and added items unlockable for CKO:
-- separate dialog option: Maltise, Ithilrandir, Aeldarian, Syla, Burilgi, Heynrich, Alaric, Rasmus
-- addition to diamonds: Kjuda, Zulkar
-- items enabled via script - changed abundance 100->1

- during promotions in a KO's hierarchy player will receive given KO's shield as well (so far only armor and horse) 
- added Order of the Kraken Cultists - very strong infantry with ranged capabilities upgradeable from Fierdsvain nobles

- King Gregory IV not going to create Falcons
- reduced honor required to join Eventide 20->5
- handle Snake's or Heretic's Book to enemy order (castle) to receive small gratitude and boost to relations (1 book = +1, 3 books = +5)
- Griffons: 
-- other kings would not create this chapter
-- player can create chapter without Sir Darlion or "letter", if he/she created own kingdom and follows Old Pendor culture
- all knights have a chance to appear in the tavern; knights share some information about their orders
- halved chance of generating free knights and sergeants in chapters owned by player; a side note: intention of the creator of this feature was to give player free 1 knight per chapter per month (on average as it is random), but changes in the other part of the code made it 10x more (10-12 soldiers); now it is still generous 5-6
9. ALEXIOS OF MELITINE
- adds only allowed modifier to the item (e.g. max for "leather" armors is hardened, not lordly)
- player can ask once (per upgrade session) to accelerate upgrade process (-33% time, cost per day = 50% item price reduced by party trading skill, then divided by total upgrade days needed)
- will work with almost all items (only Qualis and unique items are excluded); days to reach each stage are as follows

"NOTES/KNOWN ISSUES"
1. Right mouse click on any warband or fief on the world map may be useful
2. soldiers on the battlefield may not follow player's orders; try in this order: 
- reselect group
- use tactical map to give orders (Backspace)
- press U to disassemble formations
- disable advanced formations in CAMP->POP Options
3. After issuing order "use only blunt weapon":
- mounted units not initially equipped with such weapon will stay in one place - are able to e.g. follow player or go to point on the minimap, but not charge)
- while this order is active, soldiers without blunt weapon will be periodically re-equipping non-blunt one 
4. Quest "rescue prisoner" - rare Native bug - lord, which player is about to rescue, attacks player - restart game session
5. After CKO's item upgrade, player is not able to leave castle interior using entrance doors - need to press "leave" key instead
6. During some sieges some attacking archers do not return fire
7. In inventory (only) small bits of some items (e.g. ends of red feathers on a Steel Sallet) are white
8. Tourney Armors in the cheat menu are transparent - unused, but hardcoded items; can't be removed, but both mesh and texture were reduced to minimum
9. Some troops names are made up (e.g. words from two different languages are merged together)
