- Clarion Call Rangers are now recruited from Sarleon Knights (- before they were recruited from Pendor Knights) and their chapter house can be built if the player embraces the Sarleon culture.
- Lion Knighood chapter house can now be built also when the player embrases the Sarleon chapter (no longer restricted to just being a Sarelon vassal or owning the capital Sarleon).
- Likewise; Dragon Knights, Lady Valkyries, Immortals, Windriders now also can be built if the player embraces their respective cultures.
- Falcon knights are now female knights.
- A hint is given when you talk to defeated lords (regarding the chances you have of having them join you).
- Siege retreats incur a small controversy increase for the player (- and if the player is a liege then his vassals have a 20% chance for each vassal lord of getting a small relationship hit too). The old penalties also apply.

3.42 Save game compatible with PoP 3.411
- Adjusted the following shields' sizes: Anaconda Shield, Netherworld Shield, Ancient Engraved Shield.
- Made the Empire Princeps Armor available in armor stores (low abundance).
- Wages for ranged troops with lvl30 or higher has been increased by 33%.
- More re-balancing of trade good items.
- Agressiveness and Initiative for lords following another lord have been increased.
- The formula for getting a fief when asking for it for player vassals has been modified. Now it caps the player's renown to about 1300 to 1700 when the player asks for a center he/she captured. If the player didn't capture the center then the player renown is capped at 1000 to 1400. This makes it so that other lords will be getting centers if the player already has some centers, despite the player having a lot of renown. It also makes it possible for the player to revolt more often and prevents the player from growing too powerful when being a vassal. Other factors that will decrease the capped value are: Player Right-to-Rule and Player Controversy (- both of these are subtracted from the cap value to lower the capped value).
- Fixed a native issue in dialogs when talking about replacing marshals.
- Reworked lairs. They now get reinforced with boss troops too. The boss troops are strong. The Red brotherhood lair (aka treasure map location) now has guildsmen as regular troops. The Snake Cult shrines have snake cult armsmen as regular troops. This also makes the initial rescue mission a bit harder because the boss troops there are also affected. The starting merchant will recommend you to hire some troops with experience and good equipment. The boss troop change needs a new game to take effect but they won't mess up anything in your current save game so it is save game compatible. The new bosses also bring in new loot with them.
- Tournament equipment: Daggers are now replaced with clubs for archers (foot and mounted). The lance wielders and javelineers are now equipped with clubs as secondary weapons.
- Fixed a bug in the Ghost lady quest.
- Updated graphics resources with the work of Four_Leaf_Clover: This improves a large number of items' reflections to be less glossy and to be more optimized.

3.411 Not Savegame compatible with 3.41
- Fixed Red Brotherhood chest.
- Reverted Kill counter to not being continuous (to reduce potential lag). Use minimap on/off to get the kill counter to display if it does not.

- Changed Pendor Cavalry from level 30 to level 20 (to fix upgrade issue).

- Relationship needed for lords to join is now:
Relationship needed for lord to want to join = 15 + campaign difficulty modifier (5 for medium and 10 for hard) - player persuasion skill + lord type (10 if duke and 0 otherwise) + number of castles for the lord's faction + (2 * number of towns for the lord's faction) - min(number of Pendor castles,5) - min(number of Pendor Towns,3)

- Fixed the no parry issue with ravenstern battleaxe and knight war axe.

- Reworked some items regarding different aspects such as price, requirements, etc.
- The kill counter will no longer stay invisible after using the Esc key or opening the battle chest.
- Sarleon Armored footman has been given a morningstar instead of warhammer (- due to these soldiers always knocking out enemies because of their previous blunt weapon).
- Lords joining the player via relationship has been reworked. Before they would join if their relationship was 20 or greater. Now it is according to this formula: 
  Relationship needed for lord to want to join = 15 + campaign difficulty modifier (5 for medium and 10 for hard) - player persuasion skill + lord type (10 if duke and 0 otherwise) + number of castles for the lord's faction + (2 * number of towns for the lord's faction)
- Snake cult lairs are guarded by snake cult armsmen instead of snake cult followers now.
- Honorable lords do not gain as much bonus from player honor as they used to get.
- Tournaments can only be entered if you have garnered some renown.
- It is possible to acquire more unique items now.
- Defection has been reworked a bit (lords with fiefs gain bonus relations with their liege during convergence according to a small base value and bonus from fiefs. For lord convergences between each other the convergence is like before.

- Lord parties who are accompanying another party are a bit more courageous than before (they don't flee as easily).
- Added Caba'Drin's Dynamic Groups code (thanks Caba'Drin!)
- Jatu armies reduced in numeric strength slightly (because their raiders and lancers are harder to beat now).
- Two additional Sarleon Barons have received household troops.
- Jatu Hunter resurrected from the dead.
- Small fixes for typos and minor changes.
- Fixed an issue with the Archer Defender Siege AI.
- New Weapons, shields and armors have been introduced (and a few weapons gave been re-introduced).
- Patrol radius for small knight groups and patrols have been tightened so they patrol their area better.
- The steward now recruits from all bound villages (not only the player owned bound villages). This is a bug fix.
- The faction kings’ hired Mercenary parties have higher initiative values.
- Lords no longer automatically bring over their holdings to the player faction when they change allegiance to the player faction. Instead it is based on several factors (where campaign difficulty, player persuasion, relation with lord and lord rank are deciding factors).
- Honor gain and relation boost reduced when freeing captured lords.
- Honor gained by winning tournaments.
- Increased relation requirement for lords to be willing to join player faction when talked to from capture dialogue (from 7 to 20).

- Reworked mercenary payment a bit (not as profitable as before).
- A new tribe has joined the Mystmountains: The Bearclaw Berserkers! These highly agile berserkers in full Bearclaw Armor are rightfully feared in the North. While perhaps not as skilled as the Fierdsvein berserkers they are more agile and more armored and they wield big axes :) If you are lucky you may come across a few who might join your army.
- Kings will not accept vasselage of players who have a relatively high right to rule.
- A new mercenary unit known as the Melitine Mercenary Lancer has been seen in taverns ... it is rumoured to come from a far away place named Amala!

Changes from POP 3.01 and Warband:
- New and updated items by Archangel
- Updated scenes and additional item LODs by Sysyphe

- The economy is a hybrid PoP/WB, with POP building improvements
- Sarranids (6th kingdom) were removed, but their items are available in D'Shar stores

- Additional companion dialogs and traits needed for Warband

Selected tweaks:
- Many troop and item stats were rebalanced
- Prisoner Mgmt skill: lowered prisoners per point from 15 to 10
- Map: moved several villages, so towns always have at least two of them
- Adjusted spawning probabilities of minor factions to be more balanced (less Heretic armies, more Snake Warbands etc. - spawns should be more diverse now); added missing messages for 3 Seers, Eyegrim and Noldor lords spawning
- Sorted most of the party templates (including kingdom reinforcements) to place stronger troops first (with some exceptions where strong troops appear at a later battle phase to make things interesting, like for Noldor Lords, Burilgi etc.)
- AI garrisons sorted by troop level and real strength whenever they are reinforced or gain xp, archers biased by +25% (i.e. moved up), order troops moved down (-50%) so it's not impossible to siege an order town
- Kingdom reinf. templates rewritten: more balance between kingdoms, kingdom parties get their Order troops like in 2.5
- Tweaked down tax inefficiency
- Disabled Warband renown reduction when renown is high
- Halved speed of night fighting for every AI battle
- Some Empire troops (Legionnaire, Noble Legionnaire Recruit, Gladiator, Immortal) changed to infantry, less spear-throwing (Empire parties autocalc values now more in line with the rest)

- Corrected building effects or description text for several buildings so they are consistent with each other
- Map: wayward vertex near Valorshield moved - caused parties to get stuck
- Map: flipped to face north

Warband bugs fixed:
- Removed a set of duplicate banners 
- Fixed a WB bug that prevents the last prisoner troop of a certain type to escape (causing enormous prisoner lists in castles etc.)
- Economy: WB bug fixed - symptoms were inflated prices and shortage of goods in stores; production of various goods rebalanced for POP (e.g. fish produced only in coastal villages and towns); boosted number of different goods in stores
- Lords seem to defect to a single faction
- Lords go on to siege castles recently captured by their own faction


Have fun!
The POP Dev Team


Personal note from MadVader:
Despite having plenty of fun porting and developing POP 3.2, I'm retiring from modding into real life. As the Gods of Pendor would usually have it, the right person showed up at the right time, so Treebeard will carry the coding torch from now on. I wish him and the POP team best of luck in creating the next release.
I'd like to thank the excellent people on the POP Dev Team and the loyal POP fans for pushing POP to the next level. Special thanks to Saxondragon for showing me what game design is about.
