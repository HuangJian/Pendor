UP TO DATE TRANSLATIONS:

INFO:

- extra folder in the mod directory (search your folders for “_README_POP” name):
---- OPTIONAL_FONT_ENG - English font optimized for this mod, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED; do not use on Linux or Mac
---- OPTIONAL_FONT_RUS_UKR_ENG - Russian and Ukrainian font plus alternative version of English one; do not use on Linux or Mac
---- OPTIONAL_ARCHERS_SIEGE_DEFENCE_BEHAVIOUR - by Dalion - all defending archers, which appear as reinforcements, will be distributed amongst all archers spawning points; script treat all soldiers with long range weapons as archers, not only the ones in the assigned archers group; it is savegame compatible, so can be tested any time in the game
---- OPTIONAL_TEXTURES_BY_SAXONDRAGON - alternative terrain textures done by the mod creator
---- PROMOTIONAL FORUM BANNERS - spread the world

- if you think that archery deals too much / not enough damage then open "module.ini" file located in the mod folder and find "missile_damage_speed_power = 1.2"; reduce number (minimum 0.1) to make archery more deadly, increase (maximum 2.0) to obtain opposite result

- how to reduce chance for SAVEGAME CORRUPTION (apply to any Warband mod):
--- when you want to start the new game, restart Warband first
--- don't play with realistic saves
--- use all 9 save slots (note: if all 9 slots are occupied, the new game can't be started - delete one)
--- save in scenes e.g. tavern
--- if you want to save on the world map then stop to pause the game, count to 5 (so scripts running in the background have time to finish), press save

KNOWN ISSUES:

- the "hold F1 flag" can't be used together with advanced formations (jkl keys; like shielsdwall), otherwise selected soldiers may start to move backward to the edge of the map; with "advanced formations" use mini-map, "hold this position" and "advance/fall back ten paces" to move groups around; POP's default (build-in Warband's) formations work fine
- if during fight enemy stuck in inaccessible area (e.g. inside building structure) use CTRL+F4 (kill one enemy); it is not recognized as a cheat, there is no punishment, but overusing it will kill the fun pretty quickly
- if the game become too slow, restart it; due to Warband memory leak a play session will slow down over time and many reloads accelerate this process
- lords attack player during prisoners escape - restart current game session and repeat mission (Warband bug)
- "Cows in the water" - remove TexturesHD folder found in the main Warband folder
- NPC party stuck on river bank or shore - try right mouse click on it
- very rarely the new garrisons/prisoners hotkeys may produce unexplained errors due to improper usage by players (e.g. used "take all prisoners" hotkeys on the garrisoned soldiers); this feature is build on the top of inaccessible part of engine, so use it with care, accordingly to the provided instruction:
--- select troops/prisoner stack AND hold one of the keys combination listed below AND press give/hire/take/capture button
--- capture all prisoners - LEFT CTRL + A
--- take all prisoners from garrison - LEFT CTRL + A
--- give all prisoners to garrison - LEFT CTRL + D
--- hire all soldiers - LEFT CTRL + S
--- give all soldiers to garrison - RIGHT CTRL + ARROW LEFT
--- take all soldiers from garrison - RIGHT CTRL + ARROW RIGHT
--- move stack one position up inside garrison - ARROW UP - (doesn't work if single soldier in the stack)
--- move stack one position down inside garrison - ARROW DOWN - (doesn't work if single soldier in the stack)
--- move stack to the top of garrison - PAGE UP - (doesn't work if single soldier in the stack)
--- move stack to the bottom of garrison - PAGE DOWN - (doesn't work if single soldier in the stack)

FIXED BUGS/ISSUES:

- due to very rare bug of unknown source it was impossible to finish the game: lord was commanding not his own ("zero size”) party
- on rare situation lord, who lost his battle and was replenishing army, could stick in an enemy walled fief (e.g. when player rebelled, switched sides); fixed thanks to Vetrogor
- improved "use only blunt weapon" order; note: don't spam this order, wait a second or two; DOES NOT work with order issued via Backspace menu; thanks to UndeadDuke
- KO's bounty quest - points should be added correctly when player joins the battle which was started by AI
- fixed inappropriate upkeep for KO stronghold
- during "Prisoner Escape" quest all guarding units (like KO/MKO/CKO knights and sergeants, household troops) will join the fight
- fixed an issue with certain horses not being healed by Derafsh
- some quest dialogs mistakes fixed and redone for consistency
- fixed: if during fiefs exchange conversation player leaves dialog screen (e.g. clicked on lord's picture) name of the random lady is displayed as offered fief
- item "Missile speed" will be displayed properly for the newly added/edited items
- moved extra animations from walk_forward_left to walk_forward_left_polearm (thanks to Hoboistice for tips)

GAMEPLAY:

- info about next payday will be displayed in the Reports menu (correct date will be presented after 1st game week)
- below patrols will drop prisoners in a walled fief if they have >=35 prisoners or a ratio prisoners to healthy escort members is >=50%:

--- Fallen Warrior: removed not guaranteed horse, converted from units level >31 (was >=31)
- Heretic Army has (Looting+6)% chance to drop Netherworld Shield
- added POP Options to increase/decrease some of the CKO constants; as a result player can adjust CKO feature to the predicted game length (so CKO could be actually used in the faster games or e.g. accelerate CKO development until it reaches KO level, then set back to default)
--- default values set as they used to be up to now
--- all options can be changed at any time (but won't affect item is progress)
--- chance of stats upgrade during training sessions with companion (checked every 18hr): from 1.5% to 50%, default 3%
--- equipment cost: from 10% to 200%, default 100%, minimum 1000 denars
--- equipping time: from 10% to 200%, default 100%, minimum 1 day
- if KO "order challenge quest" is in progress, KO "bounty quest" won't give any troops as reward; return "order challenge quest" first, then "bounty quest" to have a chance to receive troops
- Knights of the Griffon won't be offered by ransom brokers if their chapter don't exist
- added new options to the menu Cheats -> Fix my game
--- to reset jobs of blacksmith and stable boy in Old Ruins (just in case)
--- "Purge the world" - attempt to reduce sizes of all field armies (not currently in the battle) to the selected maximum value (from 1k to 10k) by removing (starting from the bottom) stacks of troops with level <35; low level soldiers will be disbanded first (level thresholds: <=10, <=19, <=25, <=34); there is one extra option to set max to 1k and completely ignore level cap during disbanding operation
